I received my Ph.D. degree in July 2021 from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University. In December 2021, I joined the Department of Precision Instrument at Tsinghua University as a postdoctoral researcher under the "Shuimu Scholar" program, working with Prof. Luping Shi. I have been recognized with several honors, including the Outstanding Ph.D. Graduate of Tsinghua University, the Outstanding Ph.D. Dissertation Award of Tsinghua University, and the 2022 National Postdoctoral Innovative Talent Support Program.

#Research Interests#:

ðŸ”¹ Brain-Inspired Foundation Models â€“ Theoretical foundations and architectures beyond traditional LLM paradigms.

ðŸ”¹ Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) â€“ Neuromorphic computing and biologically plausible neural networks and learning algorithms.

ðŸ”¹ Brain-Inspired Robotics â€“ Brain-inspired reinforcement learning for robotics.

I am dedicated to advancing brain-inspired AI, exploring novel computing principles, and developing efficient, scalable models for real-world applications.
